Comparing household income between Baltimore, MD and Santa Barbara, CA using data from the [Opportunity Atlas.](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/)

This analysis looks at both immigrant and US born household income data, broken down by race. Two separate data sets from the Opportunity Atlas were utilised in this analysis. The first is the [household income for immigrants](https://github.com/njeeva/baltimore-vs-santa-barbara/blob/master/cty_kfr_imm_allSubgroups.csv) broken down by county and subgroups including parent income, child race and child gender. The second is the [household income for U.S born](https://github.com/njeeva/baltimore-vs-santa-barbara/blob/master/cty_kfr_native_allSubgroups.csv) similarly broken down. Comparisons between Baltimore city and Santa Barbara county incomes were analyzed, as well as differences between immigrant and US born household incomes. Step by step descriptions of the analysis can be found here.

It is interesting to note that while perceptions of Santa Barbara and Baltimore vary significantly, with one evoking a more privilaged connotation, the household income levels are not significantly different for black, hispanic and white immigrant families. Infact, white immigrant families make more money in Baltimore. Asian families however, make close to 10k more in Santa Barbara. Differences in income are much more significant when observing US born families, with families of all races in Santa Barbara making close to 20k more. Another interesting point is the fact that asian, black and hispanic immigrants make more money than their US born counterparts. Further analysis of reasons for this difference could lead to insight into unique challenges that these communities face.
